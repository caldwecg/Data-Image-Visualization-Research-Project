# Nodemon

Server side handling is done through Node.js to server web pages to the client.
app.js: 
This is the file used to render each webpage to the client. The HTML pages are now ejs files stored in /views. These pages are capable of dynamic rendering of images.

# Data manipulation

filescraper.py: 
This is the script used to filter through the 50 pages of generated HTLML code to modify images sources. This has a range of applicability and was used in place of the python file for generating the HTML. 
.bak files are generated as backup in case there is a need to access the original HTML code. 

# Notes on image selector generator script
BUG: In htmlGenerator.py

When run, this script will convet the character ">" into "&gt;" which throws an error when loading it into a browser. 
This character occurs on lines 82 and 85 of htmlGenerator.py and lines 24 and 30 of test.html. 

test.html: what is generated by htmlGenerator.py, uses three images as examles to show the selection and resulting downloadable csv file.
