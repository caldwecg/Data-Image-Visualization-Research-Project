BUG: In htmlGenerator.py

When run, this script will convet the character ">" into "&gt;" which throws an error when loading it into a browser. 
This character occurs on lines 82 and 85 of htmlGenerator.py and lines 24 and 30 of test.html. 

test.html: what is generated by htmlGenerator.py, uses three images as examles to show the selection and resulting downloadable csv file.
